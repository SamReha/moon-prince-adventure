While on vacation on the planet EARTH, you recieved a distress call from your father, MOON KING. Though the message is garbled, you ascertain that he is in serious trouble, and that MOON DUKE, your dastardly uncle has lead a coup against the MOON KINGDOM!

Quickly, you hop into your luxurious SPACE SHIP, and take to the skies to return home! However, while transiting between Earthly and Lunar orbit, you are set upon by SPACE ASSASSINS, no doubt sent by MOON DUKE. Though you bravely dodge their laser blasts, a lone beam eventually strikes the left nacelle of your SPACE SHIP, spending you spiralling towards the surface of the MOON. You stuggle to maintain control of your craft, but eventually are forced to attempt a crash landing in the mountains east of the MOON KINGDOM. You ship smacks into the surface of the MOON with a horrible smashing noise, and though badly shaken you find yourself otherwise unharmed.

Forcing yourself to gather your thoughts, you realize what you must do:
 FIND YOUR FATHER, and RETAKE THE KINGDOM OF THE MOON."

Powerful winds sweep around you, and kick up a thick dust that does little to stop the penetrating rays emenating from the orb, which is now hot in your hands.

A single pure white beam of light emerges from the orb, and passes over the lake, ultimately coming to rest on the forhead of the mysterious statue of the LADY IN THE MOON LAKE. Suddenly, the statue shifts position. She raises her sword high above her head, and with a loud cracking noise, she throws the sword all the way across the lake, and it clatters to the ground on the pier. You reach down and collect the sword, which shimmers magnificently in your hand. The orb stops flashing, and descends into your open hand.

As your weapon bounces off of your opponent's, each strike causes it to ring a beautiful and graceful note, like some sort of grand tuning fork. Eventually, you realize that you aren't even moving the sword yourself at all, the sword itself is moving as if possessed, striking harder and faster than even your own respectable skill could muster. MOON DUKE is becoming increasingly frustrated as the duel drags on, and his attacks are becoming more and more desperate, more impatient and less rational. As MOON DUKE's blade strikes yours ever harder, the ringing of your blade grows louder and louder, until it is nearly deafening. Eventually, you bring down a mightly blow towards MOON DUKE's head, and as he raises his sword to block and your blades connect, his bastardsword shatters like glass, and tiny shards of metal tinkling to the ground around the two of you.[line break][line break]For a moment, MOON DUKE stands there motionless, seemingly unsure of how to react.

Though your blade is light, MOON DUKE is fast and powerful, parrying your every blow. As your weapon bounces off of your opponent's, each strike causes it to ring a beautiful and graceful note, like some sort of grand tuning fork. Eventually, you realize that you aren't even moving the sword yourself at all, the sword itself is moving as if possessed, striking harder and faster than even your own respectable skill could muster. MOON DUKE is becoming increasingly frustrated as the duel drags on, and his attacks are becoming more and more desperate, more impatient and less rational. As MOON DUKE's blade strikes yours ever harder, the ringing of your blade grows louder and louder, until it is nearly deafening. Eventually, you bring down a mightly blow towards MOON DUKE's head, and as he raises his sword to block and your blades connect, his bastardsword shatters like glass, and tiny shards of metal tinkling to the ground around the two of you.[line break][line break]For a moment, MOON DUKE stands there motionless, seemingly unsure of how to react.
